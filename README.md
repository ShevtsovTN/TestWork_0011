# Test Task:
Creating a classic CRUD application (Any entity can be used as a basis). 
Use only the implementation through the API, by dividing the project into two front and back-end folders. 
The TA must be performed using Vue.js/Laravel. 
(The use of patterns and the separation of logic is welcome (Repository/Services laravel - Store/Axios vue), any non-standard solution will also be a plus.)
